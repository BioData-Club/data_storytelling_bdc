If you've skipped ahead (and not run Part 1), run this code chunk to load the relevant data and plot:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(here)
source(here("R/init.R"))
```

# Part 4: Working with Color/Contrast

Color and contrast are known as `preattentive attributes`. Our unconscious brain is aware of these kinds of attributes even before we consciously process the content of a graph.

You can use color and contrast to highlight aspects of the data. Take a look at the following image. How many 3s are there in this image? How hard would it be if the 3s weren't distinct from the other digits?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/threes.png")
```

## Changing the base plot (slightly)

Remember our original plot mapped color to `title`. There's also a variable called `status` in our data. `status` has two different values: a tv show can be a `riser` (positive trend in ratings), or be a `faller` (negative trend in ratings).

Let's modify the plot to use this variable to `color` our lines:

```{r}
my_plot <- 
  ggplot(tv_shows) + 
    aes(x = seasonNumber, 
        y= av_rating, 
        group=title, 
        color = status) + 
    geom_line()

my_plot
```

## Highlighting part of your data

What if we only want to highlight one group in the data? In this case, maybe we want to highlight the *risers* in our dataset. If we color them blue, and leave the others as `grey` we can immediately highlight them as important and worth noticing in the context of the other data.

We can actually manually color our traces by using `scale_color_manual()`. This lets us manually map our values in our variable (`riser` and `faller`) to colors: (`blue` and `grey`).

```{r}
my_plot + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("riser"="blue",
                              "faller"="grey")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Putting it all together

For `my_plot`, try to recreate the following graph:

```{r}
my_plot +
  
```

## Optional: Making a Dummy Variable to color specific lines

We can manually color a single group in our data through a two step process. For example, if we want to highlight "Motor Vehicle Theft" but not the others we can:

1. make a "dummy" variable called `drama` by recoding the `genre` variable to have `Y` when this variable has "Drama" in it, and `N` for the other categories.

2. manually color the lines using `scale_color_manual()` by specifying a `values()` argument.

In order to make our new variable, we will use a command called `mutate()` to search for "Drama" in the `genre` variable.


### Using a dummy variable in our dataset

We can add a new variable using what is called a `mutate()` function. It lets us calculate a new variable, based on the other values of the variable. If you've used Excel's `IF()` function, it's very similar in terms of the syntax. We first provide a condition:

```
ifelse(offense_category == "Motor Vehicle Theft", 
                  yes = "Y", no = "N")
```

The `ifelse()` function can be read:

> If the value for `offense_category` is "Motor Vehicle Theft" THEN recode that value as "Y",
> If it doesn't equal "Motor Vehicle Theft", THEN recode that value as "N"

Run the code below and explore the table a little bit to confirm that "Motor Vehicle Theft" crimes are coded as `Y` in our new variable, `motor_theft`:

```{r}
tv_shows <- tv_shows %>% mutate(comedy = str_detect(genres, "Comedy")) 

tv_shows
```

Now we can use `scale_color_manual()` to remap the `TRUE` and `FALSE` values.

## Using `scale_color_manual()` to color our new variable

Now we have our new variable called `comedy`, we need to map the `Y` and `N` values to actual colors. We can do this by using the `scale_color_manual()` function, which lets us map values to specific colors by using the `values` argument.

```{r}
    ggplot(tv_shows) + 
    aes(x = seasonNumber, y= av_rating, group=title, 
      color = comedy) + 
    geom_line() + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("TRUE"="blue", 
                             "FALSE" = "grey")) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:10))

```


### Try out mapping colors

Try using different colors to contrast the `motor_theft` line. A small list of color names in R can be found here: https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/42-colors-names.html

If you want to see all the color names in R, you can run the code block below.

```{r}
colors()
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

my_new_plot <- ggplot(tv_shows) + 
    aes(x = seasonNumber, y= av_rating, group=title, 
      color = comedy) + 
    geom_line()

my_new_plot + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("TRUE"="blue", "FALSE"="grey"))
```


## Put it all together!

Cut and paste all your modifiers and make your final figure below!

```{r eval=FALSE}
my_new_plot +
  
```


## Optional: Highlighting a subset of the data

What if we wanted to highlight a specific time period in our dataset? We can actually subset the data. 

We want to specify this criteria in our `filter()` statement:

```{r}
tv_subset <- tv_shows %>%
  filter(seasonNumber > 2) %>%
  filter(seasonNumber < 6)
```

Now we can use this dataset to highlight this portion of the data:

```{r}

ggplot(tv_shows) + 
    aes(x = seasonNumber, y= av_rating, group=title) + 
    geom_line(color = "grey") +
  #color the subset - notice that 
  geom_line(data = tv_subset, color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3, lty=3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5, lty=3) +
  annotate("text", x=4, y=7, label="This is a critical\ntime period") +
  labs(title = "Seasons 3 to 5 are Critical") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:10))
```

# Saving High Quality Plots

We can use `ggsave()` to save our plot. By default, it will save the last plot we made. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggsave("movieplot.pdf")
```
