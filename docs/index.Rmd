# Reminder

This workshop adheres to the BioData Club Code of Conduct:

https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct 

Please be respectful of your fellow learners and help each other learn.

Remember, it's dangerous to learn alone!

# Motivation: Exploratory versus Explanatory

.pull-left[
**Exploratory analysis**: 
  - exploring and understanding the data, conducting the analysis
]
.pull-right[
**Explanatory analysis**: 
  - explaining your findings from your analysis in a coherent narrative that leads to a call to action
]
---
# Effective Visual Communication

Focus on three techniques:

- Decluttering your plot
- Annotating your graph and data
- Highlight data using Preattentive Attributes

---
# Paper Doll Approach

.pull-left[
- We're going to take a basic plot and dress it up
- Modify its appearance to make our point more understandable and immediate
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("image/giphy.gif")
```
]

# Part 2: Declutter your graph

---
# Why do we need to declutter our graphs?

- Reduce cognitive load (help tired and cranky viewers)
- Viewer can focus on what matters
- Not all information is useful for your viewer

---
# Example: London Subway Diagram

.pull-left[
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("image/london-underground.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
- Triumph of minimal design
- Removes geography
- Emphasizes: what lines to I take to get from A to B?
]

# Cognitive Load

- Think of your audience: 
    - Tired and cranky and want you to get to the point!
    - Short term memory 5 +/- 2 things at once
- Remove elements that distract from your message
    - Shadows, 3D Effects
    - Legends/too many colors 
    - Axis Titles (sometimes)

---
# Ask Yourself

- Does this element support [the point I want to make about the data?](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/3/29/declutter-this-graph)

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("image/before-after.png")
```

# Part 3: Annotating Your Graphs

# Guiding Your Viewer 

Another way we can guide people through our visualization is by using **annotations**, which can be very helpful in guiding someone through our figure. Let's review some best practices.

---
# Use your titles/captions!

- Titles can guide people to the point of your figure
- Primes people to know what to look for
- "If there is a conclusion you want your audience to reach, state it in words" - Cole Nussbaum Knaflic
---
# Don't label everything

.pull-left[- Think about only labeling the data that matters
- If you want someone to compare two shows, label them
- Think about groupings and "super categories" to help your viewers make sense of the graph]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("image/super-category.png")
```

# Preattentive attributes

.pull-left[
Color and contrast are known as `preattentive attributes`. Our unconscious brain is aware of these kinds of attributes even before we consciously process the content of a graph.

You can use color and contrast to highlight aspects of the data. Take a look at the following image. How many 3s are there in this image? How hard would it be if the 3s weren't distinct from the other digits?

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

# Best Practices for Using Color (Stephen Few)

- Use color only when needed to serve a particular communication goal
- Use different colors only when they correspond to differences of meaning in the data.
- Use soft, natural colors to display most information and bright and/or dark colors to highlight information that requires greater attention.
