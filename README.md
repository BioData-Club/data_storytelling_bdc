# Data Storytelling Workshop

Learn how to customize ggplots to make figures that communicate more effectively. 

Concepts used in this workshop are gratefully adapted from Cole Nussbaum Knaffic's wonderful book [Storytelling With Data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/).

# To Run this Workshop

Have your students click on the binder link below to open up a Binder version of RStudio. Then open up `01-starting-out.Rmd` and start playing around with the notebooks.

Note: I am still debugging the binder. To be fixed soon.

# Teaching Plan

This workshop is split into five different RMarkdown notebooks:

1. Starting Out (30 Min) - Looking at the data, reviewing `ggplot2` (`01-starting-out.Rmd`)
2. Decluttering (30 Min) - Simplifying your figure with `themes` and `theme()` (`02-decluttering.Rmd`)
3. Annotating (30 Min) - Adding labels and annotations to your figure to guide your viewer through it (`03-annotating.Rmd`).
4. Highlighting (30 Min) - Learn how to use color and contrast to emphasize different qualities in your data. (`04-highlighting.Rmd`)
5. Highlighting subsets of data (optional, 30 min). Using `dplyr` and `filter` to make subsets. (`05-highlighting-subsets.Rmd`)
