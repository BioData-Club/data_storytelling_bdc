# Code Snippets to Add

Much like paper dolls, we're going to add different "clothes", or customizations to our graph to emphasize our point.

Note that these code snippets don't do anything by themselves - you need to add them to a ggplot2 statement.

When you cut and paste, remember that the ``` signifies a code block - you don't need to paste these into your ggplot2 statement.

# When building your graph

Remember that when adding your elements to the plot, you will need to end your statements in a "+"

# Declutter your graph




### Themes

There are some prebuilt themes that you can add that have some good defaults for styling. I really like `theme_minimal()`. Try cutting and pasting this to the end of your ggplot:

```
+ theme_minimal()
```

```
+ theme_bw()
```

## Changing the Color Scales

Consider 

```

```


### Using `theme()` to add and remove parts of your graph


### Remove Axis Titles


### Remove Legend

```
+
theme(legend.position="none")
```

### Change Axis Ticks

## Annotating your graph

## Adding a title

```
+ ggtitle("")
```


# Axis Text

## Changing the Axis Labels

```
+ labs(x = "Year/Month", y= "Number of Crimes")
```

## Removing the Axis Label 

Removing Both Axis Labels:

```
+ theme(axis.text = element_blank())
```

Removing the x-axis:

```
+ theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

```

Remove the grid lines:

```
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
```
